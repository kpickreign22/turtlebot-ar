# Co-localization of a Mobile Device and Robot to a Shared Map

This repository contains a Unity project for an augmented reality mobile application that
interfaces with a TurtleBot 2 via Rosbridge. To test the augmented reality application or
build it on a mobile device, follow the instructions in [Unity_Setup.md](Unity_Setup.md). To setup the 
TurtleBot and establish a WebSocket connection to broadcast odometry data, follow the
instructions in [TurtleBot_Setup.md](TurtleBot_Setup.md).
